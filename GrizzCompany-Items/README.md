# GrizzCompany - Items
Salmon Run inspired Lethal Company items.

This is part of a larger mod I have planned which will include Salmon Run inspired enemies as well. Items and enemies will be released separately so that updates dont jumpscare you with something you didn't expect.

This mod currently only includes 1 item, but there will most likely be more in the future!

## Items

### Scrap Cannon
Toss your scrap in the Scrap Cannon and send it flying, aim it well and it'll save you some trips - just make sure it doesn't end up in a ditch.

- Hold an item and interact with the top part of the cannon to launch it, and grab the cannon from the handle on the back.
- Aim the cannon towards where you want to shoot your items. It can be shot towards the ship, or any of the entrances.
- Aiming is fairly lenient, but make sure you're on target! Otherwise, it'll shoot your items forward an unknown distance (and potentially have them end up unreachable).
- Carrying the scrap cannon will slow you down and make you unable to sprint or jump - transporting it isn't easy!
